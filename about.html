    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <ul> <li>Hey! I'm a second-year Information Science engineering student with a passion for learning, problem-solving, and driving innovation. I’ve got a solid foundation in HTML and CSS basics, as well as UI/UX design and research, where I love creating user-centered designs and diving into research to improve experiences. I'm always excited to explore new tools, technologies, and frameworks to stay adaptable and grow my skills. When I'm not immersed in tech, I enjoy working on team projects, leading events, and collaborating with others. I'm eager to apply what I’ve learned through internships, gain hands-on experience, and make a real impact in the industry!</li></ul>
